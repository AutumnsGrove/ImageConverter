hello friends this is autumn it is VERY late for me but I must write some todos as I have the ideas now.

- Add Testing Guides for other languages like JS/Rust/Go
- More usage guides for things like p5.js (research included in /research/ folder) and async (research also in /research/ folder, but currently only for python)
- maybe i could multiple guides written for different languages, and, as the claude code installer assistant is guiding users through the setup, it only clones the necessary parts and/or just deletes the parts that arent needed (like, if a user is setting up a rust project, they dont need any python guides like UV or any JS guides like for Jest etc)
- `summon_me` file
    - can be called from claude code easily due to unique name as long as the cloned `baseproject` repo is in the same base directory as your agent.
    - runs the specific commands we have in @readme.md but applyies them within the ongoing claude code session
- maybe another `magic command` to add into the readme - Smart project startup
    - when claude code detects your'e close to starting a "project", like setting up a technical spec, doing research on a specific library for an extensive amount of time, describing an ideal script/project they want to create, etc., then offer to "setup the project for them" by running the original magic command (the one that clones/copies/etc. etc....) and customizing it etc.
    - will run the whole workflow ~auto-magically~ ╰( ⁰ ਊ ⁰ )━☆ﾟ.*･｡ﾟ
